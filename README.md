# MedHelp
The problem statement revolves around addressing the common scenario where users search the net for their symptoms, often leading to inaccurate self-diagnoses due to the abundance of information online. To mitigate this, MedHelp utilizes a robust algorithm to analyze user symptoms and predict probable diseases, thereby minimizing the chance of incorrect assumptions about their condition. The solution is a comprehensive web application that not only recommends doctors with matching specialties and aligned schedules but also enables users to book appointments, rate doctors, and filter them based on various criteria such as ratings, fees, and timings. Additionally, the system includes administrative functionalities such as approving doctor requests and managing user and doctor profiles, ensuring a seamless healthcare recommendation experience.
